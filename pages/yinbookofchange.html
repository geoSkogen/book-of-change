      <p class="inform">As the name implies, a hexagram consists of six lines.
       These can represent either <i>yin</i> or <i>yang</i>.</p>
      <p class="inform" id="centered"> <i>yin</i> line: &ndash;&nbsp;&ndash;<br/>
                         <i>yang</i> line: &mdash;<br/><br/>


      <p class="inform">The Chinese of antiquity drew hexagrams from manipulated
       yarrow stalks.  I learned to draw hexagrams by tossing coins: build
       hexgrams from the bottom&ndash;up, each line based on the coin-toss
       results.</p><br/>

      <p class="inform">There is a good chance that a coin-toss will draw a "moving"
       line.  Either <i>yin</i> will dissolve into <i>yang</i>, or <i>yang</i>
       dissolve into <i>yin.</i> This always results in two hexagrams: one with moving
       lines, and the other with the still lines that follow.</p><br/>

       <h4>trigrams</h4>

      <p class="inform">The hexagram is actually the joining two trigrams.
        The set of trigrams contains all eight possible combinations of <i>yin</i> and
        <i>yang</i> that result from three coin-tosses. Each trigram represents
        an element or force of nature.</p>
      <br/>
      <div class="flexOuter"><button>show trigram table</button></div>
      </br>
      <p class="inform">The intersection of two trigrams indentifies one of the 64
        possible hexagrams. The hexagram represents a
        single phase&mdash;one 'change'&mdash;in an ever-moving stream of changes.
        A hexagram with moving lines also demands a look at one of the 4032 (63 x 64)
        possible shifts between phases as represented in one hexagram becoming another.</p>

   <p class="tabHeader">Gottfried Liebniz</p><p class="inform"> At the turn of the
      18th Century this German philosopher&mdash;now cannonized as the man who
      invented calculus&mdash;had also invented an arithmetic we now take for granted
      as the binary system.  Being one of the first	European thinkers to take a
      scholarly interst in Chinese civilization, Liebniz would've already seen how
      the ancient <em>I Ching</em>'s hexagrams corresponded to
			the binary numbers 000000 through 111111&mdash;0 to 63.</p>
   <p class="inform">
 			Liebniz reveled in the <em>I Ching</em>, citing its mere existence as
			affirmation of his own religious beliefs. He even sent a copy of the 64
			hexagrams to the Duke of Brunswick, enclosed with a letter:
			<p class="bolded">It is not easy to impart the creation <em>ex nihilo</em>
			through God's almighty power. Now one can say that nothing in the world
			can better present and demonstrate this power better than the origin of
			numbers, as it is presented here through the simple unadorned presentation
			 of One and Zero or Nothing.</p></p>
    <p class="inform">Despite its centrality to his spiritual
			 convictions, Liebniz's binary math aroused scant interest among thinkers
			 of his era. It was only via happenstance spanning a nearly 140-year
			 succession of scholarship that his system fell into place as the
			 indispensible object code which we still use to communicate with
			 machines.</p><br/><br/>
    <p class="tabHeader">George Boole</p><p class="inform">In 1854 he published
      <em>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought</em>,
			 proposing that logic might proceed through a type of algebra based on
			 binary variables&mdash;either true or false, represented as 1 or 0&mdash;and the
			 formal logical operators of conjunction, disjunction, negation,
			 implication, exclusivity, and equivalence.</p><br/>
    <p class="tabHeader">Claude E. Shannon</p><p class="inform">
      As part of his 1937 master's thesis at MIT, he included a section
  			 demonstrating that any numerical or logical problem could be navigated
  			 through the arrangement of electro-mechanical relays using Boolean
  			 algebra and binary arithmetic.</p><br/>
    <p class="tabHeader">John Atanasoff</p><p class="inform">In 1939,
       while serving as a physics professor at Iowa State, he
			 prototyped what is now recognized as the first digital computer&mdash;an
			 electronic device employing vacuum tubes as switches which solved
	     simultaneous linear equations through binary math and Boolean logic.</p><br/>
    <p class="tabHeader">Grace Hopper </p><p class="inform">As part of
       Harvard University's Bureau of Ships Computation Project,
			 she pioneered programming of the IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled
			 Calculator&mdash;the "Mark I"&mdash;during World War II.  This led to her
			 development of A-0&mdash;Arithmetic Language version 0&mdash;which translated
			 programmers' source code into binary object code for the newly
			 constructed UNIVAC I.  This was the first compiler.</p><br/>
